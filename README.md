# SVG Animated Clouds

This project is a practical implementation of realistic, animated SVG clouds, inspired by the article "[Drawing Realistic Clouds with SVG and CSS](https://css-tricks.com/drawing-realistic-clouds-with-svg-and-css/)" from CSS-Tricks. The project adds a unique twist to the concepts outlined in the article, presenting an immersive cloud animation that's pleasing to the eye.

## Overview

In this project, we create photorealistic clouds using SVG filters, JavaScript, and CSS. The clouds are generated dynamically and animate consistently, giving the impression of an infinite, serene sky. The animation effect is a custom creation, distinct from the static clouds presented in the original article.

## Features

- Dynamic generation of SVG cloud elements
